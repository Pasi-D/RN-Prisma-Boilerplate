# typescript-graphql-auth

This example demonstrates how to implement a **GraphQL server with an email-password-based authentication workflow using TypeScript** based on Prisma & [graphql-yoga](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-yoga).

## Get started

### 1. Install the Prisma CLI

You need to have the Prisma CLI installed on your machine to run this example. If you don't have it yet, execute the following command to install it globally on your machine:

```
npm install -g prisma
# or `yarn global add prisma`
```

### 2. Download example & Install dependencies

Clone the repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:prisma/prisma-examples.git
```

Install Node dependencies:

```
cd prisma-examples/typescript-graphql-auth
yarn install # or `npm install`
```

### 3. Deploy the Prisma API

You will now deploy the Prisma API that's backing this example. This requires you to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed on your machine (if you don't have Docker follow the collapsed instructions below the code block):

Launch Prisma via Docker:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Navigate into the `prisma` directory and deploy the Prisma API:

```
cd prisma
prisma deploy
```

 <summary><strong>I don't have Docker installed on my machine</strong></summary>

To deploy your service to a demo server (rather than locally with Docker), follow these steps:

- Run the following command:
  ```
  cd prisma
  prisma deploy --new
  ```
- In the interactive CLI wizard:
  - Select the **Demo server**
  - For all following questions, choose the suggested values by just hitting **Enter**

</details>

### 4. Start the server

```
yarn start
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) in your browser to explore the API of your GraphQL server in a [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground).

### 5. Explore the API of your GraphQL server

#### Open a Playground

You can either start the [desktop app](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground) via

```sh
yarn playground
```

Or you can open a Playground by navigating to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) in your browser.

#### Register a new user with the `signup` mutation

You can send the following mutation in the Playground to sign up a new user and retrieve an authentication token for them:

```graphql
mutation {
  signup(name: "Alice", email: "alice@prisma.io", password: "graphql") {
    token
  }
}
```

#### Logging in an existing user with the `login` mutation

This mutation will log in an existing user by requesting a new authentication token for them:

```graphql
mutation {
  login(email: "alice@prisma.io", password: "graphql") {
    token
  }
}
```

#### Checking whether a user is currently logged in with the `me` query

For this query, you need to make sure a valid authentication token is sent along with the `Bearer`-prefix in the `Authorization` header of the request. Inside the Playground, you can set HTTP headers in the bottom-left corner:

Once you've set the header, you can send the following query to check whether the token is valid:

```graphql
{
  me {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
```

If the token is valid, the server will return the `id`, `name`, and `email` of the `User` node that it belongs to.
